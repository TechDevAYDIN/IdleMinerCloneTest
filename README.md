# IdleMinerCloneTest

Here are some script files I developed for a project that will be a 3D clone of the game called Idle Miner Tycoon. These files belong to a project that has not yet been completed, so they cannot work fully at the moment. My aim in this project is; Writing clean, readable and maintainable code on topics such as design patterns and OOP.
